# Sinatra MVC Lab - Pig Latinizer

In this lab, you'll be building a **Pig Latinizer** using Sinatra and the MVC
paradigm of app development. Pig Latin is a made-up language formed from English
by transferring the initial consonant or consonant blend (for example, "ch" or
"str") of each word to the end of the word along with the syllable "-ay". If the
word begins with a vowel sound, then we add the sound of "way" to the end of the
word.

Examples:

- "noodle soup" becomes "oodlenay oupsay"
- "flatiron school" becomes "atironflay oolschay"
- "big apple" becomes "igbay appleway" (note the added "w" in "appleway")

Your app will take in a string from a user through a form, convert it to pig
latin, and return the string to the user. Using the previous code-along as a
guide, get the tests to pass by building out this application. Use the guide
below to get you started!

## Instructions

1. Build a form to take user input in user_input.erb. Show that form using a
   `GET` request at `/`.

2. Create a `POST` method in your controller (`app.rb`) to receive your form's
   `params`.

3. Build a `PigLatinizer` model (in your models directory) that converts a
   string into pig latin.

4. In your application controller, create an instance of the `PigLatinizer`
   class to convert your user input to Pig Latin.

5. Use ERB within a new view to display the final pig latin string to the user.
